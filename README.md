# Chibuzor Ehiemere
As the name shows, I'm Chibuzor Ehiemere. A Mobile Videographer and soon to be Software Engineer.
I am a 23 years old Petroleum engineering graduate who believes in passion rather than societal influence.
Despite my family made me study petroleum engineering cause they felt that was the best option for me, I am still chasing my passion of being a software engineer. 
I am a creative and I believe my creative journey doesn't just end in creating videos and contents. I believe I can do more in the technology space.
I am creating this repo to remind myself of why I embarked on this software engineering journey with ALX so that each time I feel like giving up, i can easily come here for reference.
By 25 I want to be a professional software engineer.
By 25 I want to be a popular Youtuber.
By 25 I want to be in Canada.
By 25 I want to be an Instagram Influencer.
By 25 I want to be known by thousands of people as a multi-talented nigerian girlie. 
My dream in life is to be a source of inspiration to all creatives spread all over the world.
This is a wake up letter to myself to remind me always that I am a work in Progress and I can do whatever I put my mind to!
Cheers!!
# The End.
